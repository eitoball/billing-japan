"An invoice represents a claim for payment. The issuance of an invoice may "
"take place either before or after the payment is carried out. When an "
"invoice is issued before payment it represents a request to the Buyer to "
"pay, in which case the invoice commonly contains information that enables "
"the Buyer, in the role of a debtor, to correctly initiate the transfer of "
"the payment, unless that information is already agreed in prior contracts or "
"by means of payment instructions separately lodged with the Buyer."

"If an invoice is issued after payment, such as when the order process "
"included payment instructions or when paying with a credit card, online or "
"telephonic purchases, the invoice may contain information about the payment "
"made in order to facilitate invoice to payment reconciliation on the Buyer "
"side. An invoice may be partially paid before issuing such as when a pre-"
"payment is made to confirm an order."
