"Companies audit themselves as means of internal control or they may be "
"audited by external parties as part of a legal obligation. Accounting is a "
"regular, ongoing process whereas an audit is a separate review process to "

"process places certain information requirements on an invoice. These "
"requirements are mainly related to enable verification of authenticity and "
