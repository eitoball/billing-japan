"| In the PINT data model BT-60 and BT-90 are business terms that are defined independently of each other. Both map onto PayeeParty/PartyIdentification/ID. However, the cardinalities stated in the syntax block simultaneous use of the BT-60 and BT-90 identifiers. This situation might arise if the payment provision is to be based on factored SEPA direct debit.\n"
